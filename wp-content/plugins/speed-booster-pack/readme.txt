= Main Plugin Features =

* **Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS** in your content.
* **Move scripts to the footer** to improve page loading speed.
* **Minify and inline all CSS and move them to footer** to optimize CSS delivery.
* **Minify HTML and JavaScript** to increase your page speed.
* **Defer parsing of JavaScript files** to reduce the initial load time of your page.
* **Remove query strings from static resources** to improve your speed scores.
* **Remove junk header tags** to clean up your WordPress head code.
* **Exclude scripts** from being moved to the footer or defered.
* **Remove RSD Link** if you are not using a Weblog Client or some 3rd party sites/programs that use the XML-RPC request formats.
* **Remove WordPress Version** this option is added for security reasons and cleaning the header.
* **Remove all RSS feed links** to cleanup your WordPress header.

* **Speed Booster Pack turns five!** We're celebrating SBP's birthday (20th May) with a better (WAY better) admin interface. We changed places of some of the options in the General and Advanced tabs, and put a "be careful" warning on top of the Advanced, CDN and Google Analytics tabs.

* **Updated:** The POT file is recreated and will be updated on each feature update.
* **Removed:** The "Load JS from Google Libraries" option.
* **Removed:** The "Disable all above CSS options on mobile devices" option.
* **Removed:** The "Disable XML-RPC" option.
* **Removed:** The "Remove extra Font Awesome styles" option. This will be added later, but needs a rewrite.
